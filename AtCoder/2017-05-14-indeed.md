### A - Tiling

#### Problem Statement
A binary image is an image consisting of black and white pixels.

You are given a binary image with a height of H pixels and a width of W pixels as pi,j, a rectangular array of H×W characters. pi,j corresponds to the pixel at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left in the binary image. If pi,j = '.', the corresponding pixel is white; if pi,j = '#', the corresponding pixel is black.

Additionally, you are also given two integers A and B. Your task is to produce a new image with a height of A×H pixels and a width of B×W pixels, by arranging A×B copies of the given image in A rows and B columns. Output the obtained image in the same format as the input.

#### Constraints  
1≤H≤10  
1≤W≤10  
1≤A≤10  
1≤B≤10  
pi,j is either . or #.  

#### Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
    
    H W A B
    p1,1p1,2…p1,W
    p2,1p2,2…p2,W
    :
    pH,1pH,2…pH,W
#### Output
Print (A×H)×(B×W) characters qi,j representing the obtained image with a height of A×H pixels and a width of B×W pixels, in the following format:

    q1,1q1,2…q1,B×W
    q2,1q2,2…q2,B×W
    :
    qA×H,1qA×H,2…qA×H,B×W
Here, qi,j corresponds to the pixel at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left in the obtained image. If the corresponding pixel is white, qi,j must be .; if the corresponding pixel is black, qi,j must be #.

If H=W=1, the output image will be the same as the input.

#### 题意

把输入的图像进行重复打印

#### 分析

直接重复就行

#### 代码

解法一：将每一行存为字符串，重复输出
```ruby
    #include <vector>
    #include <string>
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    int main()
    {
    	int h, w, a, b;
    	cin >> h >> w >> a >> b;
    	vector<string> pixel;
    	for (int i = 0; i<h; i++) {
    		string s;
    		cin >> s;
    		pixel.push_back(s);
    	}
    	//cout<<"-----"<<endl;
    	for (int c = 0; c<a; c++)
    	{
    		for (int i = 0; i<h; i++)
    		{
    			for (int r = 0; r<b; r++)
    			{
    				string s = pixel[i];
    				cout << s;
    			}
    			cout << endl;
    		}
    	}
    }
```

//解法二：利用求余
    
    #include <vector>
    #include <string>
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    int main()
    {
    	int h, w, a, b;
    	cin >> h >> w >> a >> b;
    	char image[10][10];
    	for (int i = 0; i<h; i++) {
    		for (int j = 0; j < w; j++)
    		{
    			char c;
    			cin >> c;
    			image[i][j] = c;
    		}
    	}
    
    	for (int i = 0; i < a * h; i++) {
    		for (int j = 0; j < w * b; j++)
    		{
    			cout << image[i% h] [j%w];
    		}
    		cout << endl;
    	}
    }
